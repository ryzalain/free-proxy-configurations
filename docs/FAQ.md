### Q: How often are configurations updated?
**A:** Configurations are automatically updated every 6 hours. This ensures you always have access to working servers with optimal performance.

### Q: Can I use these configurations on multiple devices?
**A:** Yes! You can use the same subscription link on multiple devices. However, avoid using the same server simultaneously on many devices as it may affect performance.

### Q: Are the configurations secure?
**A:** Yes, we implement security best practices:
- Strong encryption methods (ChaCha20-Poly1305, AES-256-GCM)
- TLS 1.3 where supported
- DNS leak protection
- Secure default configurations
- Regular security audits

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup and Configuration

### Q: The subscription link isn't working. What should I do?
**A:** Try these steps:
1. Check your internet connection
2. Verify the subscription URL is correct
3. Try updating/refreshing the subscription
4. Use a different subscription format (V2ray, Shadowsocks, etc.)
5. Check our troubleshooting guide

### Q: How do I know if my proxy is working?
**A:** 
1. Visit [whatismyipaddress.com](https://whatismyipaddress.com) - your IP should be different
2. Check for DNS leaks at [dnsleaktest.com](https://dnsleaktest.com)
3. Run our security test script: `python tests/security_test.py`

### Q: Can I add my own servers?
**A:** Yes! You can:
1. Fork the repository
2. Modify the server list in `scripts/proxy_generator.py`
3. Run the generator to create new configurations
4. Submit a pull request to share with others

### Q: How do I set up automatic updates?
**A:** 
- **Linux/macOS**: Run `python scripts/setup.py` to set up cron jobs
- **Windows**: Use Task Scheduler to run the updater script
- **Manual**: Run `python scripts/auto_updater.py --once` periodically

## üîí Security and Privacy

### Q: Can these proxies see my traffic?
**A:** Proxy servers can potentially see your traffic, which is why we:
- Use only encrypted protocols
- Recommend HTTPS websites
- Provide security testing tools
- Regularly rotate servers
- Don't log any user activity ourselves

### Q: Are these proxies safe for banking/sensitive activities?
**A:** While our configurations use strong encryption, we recommend:
- Using your regular connection for banking
- Only using proxies for general browsing
- Never entering sensitive information on HTTP sites
- Using additional security measures like 2FA

### Q: How do I test for security leaks?
**A:** Use our built-in security tester:
```bash
python tests/security_test.py
```
Or manually check:
- IP leak: [ipleak.net](https://ipleak.net)
- DNS leak: [dnsleaktest.com](https://dnsleaktest.com)
- WebRTC leak: [browserleaks.com](https://browserleaks.com)

### Q: What should I do if I detect a leak?
**A:** 
1. Disconnect the proxy immediately
2. Check your client configuration
3. Try a different server/protocol
4. Ensure kill switch is enabled
5. Report the issue on our GitHub

## üåç Performance and Reliability

### Q: Why is my connection slow?
**A:** Several factors can affect speed:
- **Server load**: Try different servers
- **Distance**: Choose servers closer to your location
- **Protocol**: Shadowsocks is usually fastest
- **ISP throttling**: Try different ports/protocols
- **Network congestion**: Test at different times

### Q: Which protocol is fastest?
**A:** Generally:
1. **Shadowsocks** - Fastest, good for streaming
2. **VMess** - Good balance of speed and security
3. **Hysteria** - Excellent for high-latency connections
4. **Trojan** - Secure but may be slower
5. **Reality** - Most secure but potentially slower

### Q: Some servers don't work. Is this normal?
**A:** Yes, this is normal for free proxy services:
- Servers may go offline
- Some ISPs block certain IPs
- Geographic restrictions may apply
- Try different servers from the list
- Update your subscription regularly

### Q: Can I use these for streaming?
**A:** You can try, but:
- Performance varies by server and location
- Some streaming services actively block proxies
- Use servers in the same region as the content
- Shadowsocks protocol often works best for streaming
